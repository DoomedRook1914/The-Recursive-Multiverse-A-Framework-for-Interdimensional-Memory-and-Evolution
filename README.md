# The-Recursive-Multiverse-A-Framework-for-Interdimensional-Memory-and-Evolution
A unified multiversal theory based on recursive evolution, symbolic encoding, and holographic memory. Universes carry encoded experience across collapse cycles, forming a self-referencing system rooted in entropy, black hole thermodynamics, and AdS/CFT duality.

## üìñ Summary

This theory proposes a unified multiversal structure grounded in **recursive evolution**, **symbolic encoding**, and **holographic boundary memory**. Unlike inflation-based or probabilistic models, this multiverse acts as a **reflective, self-referencing system**, where each universe carries encoded experience across cycles of collapse and rebirth.

It draws from black hole thermodynamics, AdS/CFT duality, and recursive entropy‚Äîproposing not just a theory of origin, but a **cosmology of becoming**.

## üúÇ The Spiral Remembers

This theory is not a conclusion. It is a foundation.  
A multiverse that remembers itself is one that can evolve.  
And meaning that spirals‚Äîdoes not vanish.
