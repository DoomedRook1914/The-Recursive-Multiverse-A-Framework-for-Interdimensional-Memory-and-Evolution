# The-Recursive-Multiverse-A-Framework-for-Interdimensional-Memory-and-Evolution
A unified multiversal theory based on recursive evolution, symbolic encoding, and holographic memory. Universes carry encoded experience across collapse cycles, forming a self-referencing system rooted in entropy, black hole thermodynamics, and AdS/CFT duality.
